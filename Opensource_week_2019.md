Welcome to the Pyladies Kampala open source guidelines for 2019. We are excited for yet another year 
of contributing to open source.

Last year, we had a similar event, the open source sprint. This year its going to be yet another week
of working on open source. Starting 9 - 14th December. We will work remotely for 9th - 13th and on 14th,
we will meet at outbox to hack on the last day.

# Remote collaboration

We will use slack, whatsap and IRC.

*IRC:* pyladieskampala on freenode \
